            On my YouTube channel I am creating tutorials for people who:
            - are looking for a way to leverage the power of Python in their day-to-day work.
            - are struggling with repetitive tasks in Excel and are looking for a way to use Python and VBA.
            - want to learn Data Analysis & Data Science to perform meaningful and impactful analyses.
            - are working with Excel and found themselves thinking - "there has to be a better way."
